                            The <abbr title="Reconditorium Eximium Rerum Universalium Mutabiliumque">Rerum</abbr> Consortium provides Digital Humanities software
                            solutions for increased interoperability and access.  Rerum
                            tools and services are designed to ensure free and open
                            sharing of data. Central to Rerum are OAC and IIIF as models
                            for living digital objects for data interchange.  The Rerum
                            architecture facilitates the useful development of specific
                            tools and interfaces without requiring scholars to have deep
                            control over the underlying format.

                            The Open Annotation Collaboration broke important ground on
                            08 February 2013, when they specified an interoperable framework
                            for creating associations between related resources, annotations,
                            using a methodology that conforms to the Architecture of the World
                            Wide Web.<sup>

                            </sup>
                            The next year, SharedCanvas (later absorbed by IIIF), demonstrated
                            how simply <abbr title="Open Annotation Collaboration">OAC</abbr> could be
                            extended to point to complex objects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pointing, instead of directly encoding annotations and
                            <dfn title="comments, edits, links...">annotation-like objects</dfn>
                            provides benefits for scholarship by separating the resource from
                            the annotation, allowing for more granular and irregular resources,
                            and creating a clearer history of the academic conversation.
                            By separating the resource (text, image, etc.) from the
                            annotation, the original digitized resource remains pristine and
                            can be located anywhere in the world. Selectors remove the need
                            for every reference to be to a complete resource while also
                            allowing a scholar to make a very specific annotation on a
                            smaller range of the original resource, whether or not it
                            has native segmentation within it. Finally, every annotation
                            can be individually attributed to the asserting scholar and
                            software, which makes filtering and walking back through the
                            revisions a simpler process.

                            Realizing Digital Resources
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Early facsimiles, transcriptions, and photographs tended to either
                            have very little connection to the real objects they depicted, or completely
                            stood in for them as a digital replacement. The IIIF Presentation
                            API clearly respects the role of the resource as a surrogate, while
                            normalizing the digital containers for these resources.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Rerum Consortium expands this effort by imagining digital containers
                            beyond the Canvases and Manifests of IIIF to include useful objects for
                            other media, such as audio, video, and three-dimensional models. In this
                            way, advances in annotation standards can be applied to a wider set of
                            resources and, importantly, these resources can be related to or
                            described in terms of each other.

                        A Developing Need
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Increasingly, scholars have expended time and money developing specialized
                        programs or learning new programming languages in order to address their
                        research questions successfully. Cataloguers who have already learned to
                        speak a scholarly vocabulary and then describe objects with a carefully
                        controlled schema are now being asked to understand the web ontology and
                        data exchange formats. It would feel nonsensical to ask a librarian to
                        establish the standard width for drawers in a card catalog or the height
                        of a reference desk. Likewise, Digital Humanities should be offering tools
                        that enforce standards by default and allow users to choose the motivation
                        for the task. The conventional approach of encoding resources closer to
                        the bare metal is fraught with misinterpretation and syntax errors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Digital Humanities needs developers the way libraries need electricians and
                        plumbers. Digital tools should support the standards of interoperability
                        and digital transmission invisibly and responsibly enforce the scholarly
                        standards for description, classification, and attribution. The best mind to
                        address challenging research questions should not be required to also be
                        the best mind in command-line programming, but work in concert with tools
                        which accelerate analysis, automate encoding, and translate normal scholarly
                        behavior into rich digital assets.
